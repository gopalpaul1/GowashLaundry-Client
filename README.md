# Getting Started with Create React App

# GoWash Laundry Project is here !

### Project Name: [(GoWash-Laundry)]


Project Details:

I created a project called Gowash Laundry. There are six components which are: Home, provideservice, services, review, form and footer component. I have added the coach service order and a picture in the header in the home component. Some of the services component is how we provide services. I am adding service component service. If someone orders a service, he will first take him to the login page, then he has to pay for the order, then he can see his order by going to the order list and he wants to give a review to the company by going to review option. And the admin can add and delete a service if he wants. The footer component at the end of it all shows some details of Gowash Laundry.
